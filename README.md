# AthNLP 2024

Exercises for the lab sessions of AthNLP 2024. Everything has been setup to run from a Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.

The labs will cover the following topics:

1. [Word Embeddings and Text Classification](#lab-1-word-embeddings-and-text-classification)
2. [Neural Language Modeling](#lab-2-neural-language-modeling)
3. [Sequence Structured Prediction](#lab-3-sequence-structured-prediction)
4. [Transformers and Machine Translation](#lab-4-transformers-and-machine-translation)
5. [Retrieval Augmented Generation with Large Language Models (RAG with LLMs)](#lab-5-retrieval-augmented-generation-with-large-language-models-rag-with-llms)
6. [Vision and Language Models](#lab-6-vision-and-language-models)


## Lab 0. Introductory Material

Here is a quick list of some useful tutorials to get you up to speed with Python, Numpy and Pytorch:
